I"‚<!-- # TeX Typography -->
<p>Some years ago I had to write my PhD thesis using a LaTeX template provided by the univeristy.</p>

<p>This document considers LaTeX, and in some parts XeTeX where it is clearly mentioned.</p>

<h2 id="matching-fonts">Matching Fonts</h2>
<p>TeX has two main fornt families used for text â€˜Serifâ€™ and â€˜Non Serifâ€™. There is also â€˜Type Writerâ€™ family. For math environment, there is normal math font and â€˜Match Caligraphyâ€™ font. Other font shapes might be also used in math, including â€˜Math Blackboardâ€™ and â€˜Math Scriptâ€™. Ideally all these font families should have matching shapes. Matching menas that they have relatively simillar size, weight and shape, such that they look to complement each other.</p>

<p>If a basic TeX template is used the default font/typeface is Computer Modern. This has matching fonts for all font families.</p>
