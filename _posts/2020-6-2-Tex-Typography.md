<!-- # TeX Typography -->
Some years ago I had to write my PhD thesis using a LaTeX template provided by the univeristy.  

This document considers LaTeX, and in some parts XeTeX where it is clearly mentioned. 

## Matching Fonts 
TeX has two main fornt families used for text 'Serif' and 'Non Serif'. There is also 'Type Writer' family. For math environment, there is normal math font and 'Match Caligraphy' font. Other font shapes might be also used in math, including 'Math Blackboard' and 'Math Script'. Ideally all these font families should have matching shapes. Matching menas that they have relatively simillar size, weight and shape, such that they look to complement each other.  

If a basic TeX template is used the default font/typeface is Computer Modern. This has matching fonts for all font families.

### Times Font

### Upright Greek

### XeTeX
