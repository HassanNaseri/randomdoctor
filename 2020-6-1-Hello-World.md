Over the years I have been setting up many weblogs and CMSs for differet people. For example, I remember when WordPress came out and everyone was asking to migrate. In this process, I created few blogs for myslef as well. But none of them survived beyong couple of posts. Few days ago, I got interested in Jekyll and decided to give it a go after many years of no web development. Meanwhile I started writing some notes about typesetting in TeX for a colleague, that sounded like a good subject for a blog post. I also encountered an Ad from GoDaddy for 2$ domain registration. It also sounded fun to try a random domain name by sparing $2. I went on and registered "randomdoctopr.com". So everything came together to start yet another blog. Hopefully this will last for a while :)
